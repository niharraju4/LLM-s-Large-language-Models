Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\\n\\nIn our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\\n\\nIt is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\\n\\nThe bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\\n\\nThere are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\\n\"\"\"', metadata={'source': 'N:\\\\Langchain_k\\\\DataIngestion\\\\speech.txt'})]"

       " Document(page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2', metadata={'source': 'N:\\\\Langchain_k\\\\DataIngestion\\\\attention.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3', metadata={'source': 'N:\\\\Langchain_k\\\\DataIngestion\\\\attention.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\\n4', metadata={'source': 'N:\\\\Langchain_k\\\\DataIngestion\\\\attention.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5', metadata={'source': 'N:\\\\Langchain_k\\\\DataIngestion\\\\attention.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6', metadata={'source': 'N:\\\\Langchain_k\\\\DataIngestion\\\\attention.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.

We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8', metadata={'source': 'N:\\\\Langchain_k\\\\DataIngestion\\\\attention.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7.

The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging.

However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Introduction\\nA ﬁber graph is a graph on the ﬁnitely many lattice points F ⊂Zd of a polytope where\\ntwo lattice points are connected by an edge if their diﬀerence lies in a ﬁnite set of allowed\\nmoves M ⊂Zd. The implicit structure of these graphs makes them a useful tool to explore\\nthe set of lattice points randomly: At the current lattice point u ∈F, an element m ∈±M\\nis sampled and the random walk moves along m if u + m ∈F and stays at u otherwise.\\nThe corresponding Markov chain is irreducible if the underlying ﬁber graph is connected and\\nthe set M is called a Markov basis for F in this case. This paper investigates the heat-bath\\nversion of this random walk: At the current lattice point u ∈F, we sample m ∈M and move\\nto a random element in the integer ray (u + Z · m) ∩F. The authors of [6] discovered that\\nthis random walk can be seen as a discrete version of the hit-and-run algorithm [15, 26, 16]\\nthat has been used frequently to sample from all the points of a polytope – not only from its\\nlattice points. The popularity of the continuous version of the hit-and-run algorithm has not\\nspread to its discrete analog, and not much is known about its mixing behaviour. One reason\\nis that it is already challenging to guarantee that all points in the underlying set F can be\\nDate: September 12, 2018.\\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation.

However, in many situations where a Markov\\nbasis is known, the heat-bath random walk is evidently fast. For instance, it was shown in [3]\\nthat the heat-bath random walk on contingency tables mixes rapidly when the number of\\ncolumns is ﬁxed. To work around the connectedness issue, a discrete hit-and-run algorithm\\nwas introduced in [1] for arbitrary ﬁnite sets F ⊂Zd. At each step in this random walk, a\\nsubordinate and unrestricted random walk starts at the current lattice point u ∈F and uses\\nthe unit vectors to collect a set of proposals S ⊂Zd. The random walk then moves from u\\nto a random point in S ∩F.\\nRandom walks of the heat-bath type, such as the one presented above, have been studied\\nrecently in [8] in a more general context. In this paper, we explore the mixing behaviour of\\nheat-bath random walks on the lattice points of polytopes with Markov bases. Throughout,\\nwe assume that a Markov basis has been found already and refer to the relevant literature\\nfor their computation [24, 25, 11, 17, 10, 21]. We call the underlying graph of the heat-bath\\nrandom walk a compressed ﬁber graph (Deﬁnition 2.5) and determine in Section 3 bounds on\\nits graph-diameter. We prove that for any A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A)∩Nd = {0}, the diameter of\\ncompressed ﬁber graphs on {u ∈Nd : Au = b} that use a ﬁxed Markov bases M ⊂kerZ(A) is\\nbounded from above by a constant as b varies (Theorem 3.15). In contrast, we show that the\\ndiameter of conventional ﬁber graphs grow linearly under a dilation of the underlying polytope\\n(Remark 3.9). This gives rise to slow mixing results for conventional ﬁber walks as observed\\nin [27]. In Section 4, we study in more detail the combinatorial and analytical structure\\nof the transition matrices of heat-bath random walks on lattice points and prove upper and\\nlower bounds on their second largest eigenvalues. We also discuss how the distribution on the\\nmoves M aﬀects the speed of convergence (Example 4.21). Theorem 5.8 establishes with the\\ncanonical path approach from [23] an upper bound on the second largest eigenvalue when the\\nMarkov basis is augmenting (Deﬁnition 5.1) and the stationary distribution is uniform. From\\nthat, we conclude fast mixing results for random walks on lattice points in ﬁxed dimension.\\nAcknowledgements.

The natural numbers are N := {0, 1, 2, . . .} and for any N ∈N,\\nN>N := {n ∈N : n > N} and N≥N := {N} ∪N>N. For n ∈N>0, let [n] := {1, . . . , n}. Let\\nM ⊂Qd be a ﬁnite set, then Z·M := {λm : m ∈M, λ ∈Z} and NM is the aﬃne semigroup\\nin Zd generated by M. For an integer matrix A ∈Zm×d with columns a1, . . . , ad ∈Zm,\\nwe write NA := N{a1, . . . , ad}. A graph is always undirected and can have multiple loops.\\nThe distance of two nodes u, v which are contained in the same connected component of a\\ngraph G, i.e. the number of edges in a shortest path between u and v in G, is denoted by\\ndistG(u, v). We set distG(u, v) := ∞if u and v are disconnected. A mass function on a ﬁnite\\nset Ωis a map f : Ω→[0, 1] such that P\\nω∈Ωf(ω) = 1. A mass function f on Ωis positive\\nif f(ω) > 0 for all ω ∈Ω. A set F ⊂Zd is normal if it there exists a polytope P ⊂Qd such\\nthat P ∩Zd = F.\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n3\\n2. Graphs and statistics\\nWe ﬁrst introduce the statistical framework in which this paper lives and recall important\\naspects of the interplay between graphs and statistics. A random walk on a graph G = (V, E)\\nis a map H : V × V →[0, 1] such that for all v ∈V , P\\nu∈V H(v, u) = 1 and such that\\nH(v, u) = 0 if {v, u} ̸∈E. When there is no ambiguity, we represent a random walk as an\\n|V | × |V |-matrix, for example when it is clear how the elements of V are ordered. Fix a\\nrandom walk H on G. Then H is irreducible if for all v, u ∈V there exists t ∈N such that\\nHt(v, u) > 0. The random walk H is reversible if there exists a mass function µ : V →[0, 1]\\nsuch that µ(u) · H(u, v) = µ(v) · H(v, u) for all u, v ∈V and symmetric if H is a symmetric\\nmap. A mass function π : V →[0, 1] is a stationary distribution of H if π ◦H = π. For\\nsymmetric random walks, the uniform distribution on V is always a stationary distribution.\\nIf |V | = n, then we denote the eigenvalues of H by 1 = λ1(H) ≥λ2(H) ≥· · · ≥λn(H) ≥−1\\nand we write λ(H) := max{λ2(H), −λn(H)} for the second largest eigenvalue modulus of H.\\nAny irreducible random walk has a unique stationary distribution [14, Corollary 1.17] and\\nλ(H) ∈[0, 1] measures the convergence rate: the smaller λ(H), the faster the convergence.\\nThe aim of this paper is to study random walks on lattice points that use a set of moves.\\nTypically, this is achieved by constructing a graph on the set of lattice points as follows\\n(compare to [7, Section 1.3] and [24, Chapter 5]).\\nDeﬁnition 2.1. Let F ⊂Zd be a ﬁnite set and M ⊂Zd. The graph F(M) is the graph on\\nF where two nodes u, v ∈F are adjacent if u −v ∈M or v −u ∈M.\\nA normal set F ⊂Zd is ﬁnite and satisﬁes F = convQ(F)∩Zd. A canonical class of normal\\nsets that arise in many applications, is given by the ﬁbers of an integer matrix:\\nDeﬁnition 2.2. Let A ∈Zm×d and b ∈NA. The set FA,b := {u ∈Nd : Au = b} is the b-ﬁber\\nof A. The collection of all ﬁbers of A is PA := {FA,b : b ∈NA}. For M ⊂kerZ(A), the graph\\nFA,b (M) is a ﬁber graph.\\nLet F, M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite. If the membership in F can be veriﬁed eﬃciently – for instance\\nwhen F is given implicitly by linear equations and inequalities – then it is possible to explore\\nF randomly using M as follows: At a given node v ∈F, a uniform element m ∈M is\\nselected. If v + m ∈M, then the random walk moves along m to v + m and if v + m ̸∈M,\\nthe we stay at v. Formally, we obtain the following random walk.\\nDeﬁnition 2.3. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be two ﬁnite sets. The simple walk is the random\\nwalk on F(M) where the probability to traverse between to adjacent nodes u and v is |±M|−1\\nand the probability to stay at a node u is |{m ∈±M : u + m ̸∈F}| · | ± M|−1.\\nThe simple walk is symmetric and hence the uniform distribution is a stationary distribu-\\ntion (see also [27, Section 2]). To ensure convergence, the random walk has to be irreducible,\\nthat is, the underlying graph has to be connected. The following deﬁnition is a slight adaption\\nof the generalized Markov basis as deﬁned in [21, Deﬁnition 1].\\nDeﬁnition 2.4. Let P be a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd. A ﬁnite set M ⊂Zd is a\\nMarkov basis of P, if for all F ∈P, F(M) is a connected graph.\\n4\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nWe refer to [6, Theorem 3.1] for a proof that for collections PA, a ﬁnite Markov basis\\nalways exists and can be computed with tools from commutative algebra (see also [11] for\\nmore on the computation of Markov bases). We now introduce a construction of graphs on\\nlattice points that also give rise to implementable random walks, but whose edges have far\\nmore reach.\\nDeﬁnition 2.5. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets. The compression of the graph\\nF(M) is the graph Fc(M) := F(Z · M).\\nFigure 1. Compressing graphs.\\nCompressing a graph F(M) preserves its connectedness: F(M) is connected if and only\\nif Fc(M) is connected.\\n3. Bounds on the diameter\\nIn general knowledge of the diameter of the graph underlying a Markov chain can provide\\ninformation about the mixing time. For random walks on ﬁber graphs, the chains which we\\nconsider, the underlying graph coincides with the ﬁber graph. In this section, we determine\\nlower and upper bounds on the diameter of ﬁber graphs and their compressed counterparts.\\nFor a ﬁnite set M ⊂Zd and any norm ∥· ∥on Rd, let ∥M∥:= maxm∈M ∥m∥.\\nLemma 3.1. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets, then\\ndiam(F(M)) ≥\\n1\\n∥M∥· max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈F}.\\nProof. If F(M) is not connected, then the statement holds trivially, so assume that M is a\\nMarkov basis for F. Let u′, v′ ∈F such that ∥u′ −v′∥= max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈F} and let\\nm1, . . . , mr ∈M so that u′ = v′+Pr\\ni=1 mi is a path of minimal length, then ∥u′−v′∥≤r·∥M∥\\nand the claim follows from diam(F(M)) ≥distF(M)(u′, v′) = r.\\n□\\nRemark 3.2. Let F ⊂Zd be a normal set. For all l ∈{−1, 0, 1}d and u, v ∈F we have\\n(u −v)T l ≤∥u −v∥1 and thus widthl(F) := max{(u −v)T l : u, v ∈F} ≤max{∥u −v∥1 :\\nu, v ∈F}. Suppose that u′, v′ ∈F are such that ∥u′ −v′∥1 = max{∥u −v∥1 : u, v ∈F} and\\nlet l′\\ni := sign(u′\\ni −v′\\ni) for i ∈[d], then\\n∥u′ −v′∥1 = (u′ −v′)T · l′ ≤widthl′(F) ≤max{∥u −v∥1 : u, v ∈F} = ∥u′ −v′∥1.\\nThe lattice width of F is width(F) := minl∈Zd widthl(F) and thus Lemma 3.1 gives\\n∥M∥1 · diam(F(M)) ≥width(F).\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n5\\nDeﬁnition 3.3. Let P be a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd.\\nA ﬁnite set M ⊂Zd is\\nnorm-like for P if there exists a constant C ∈N such that for all F ∈P and all u, v ∈F,\\ndistF(M)(u, v) ≤C · ∥u −v∥. The set M is ∥· ∥-norm-reducing for P if for all F ∈P and all\\nu, v ∈F there exists m ∈M such that u + m ∈F and ∥u + m −v∥< ∥u −v∥.\\nThe property of being norm-like does not depend on the norm, whereas being norm-\\nreducing does.\\nNorm-reducing sets are always norm-like, and norm-like sets are in turn\\nalways Markov bases, but the reverse of both statements is false in general (Example 3.4 and\\nExample 3.5). For collections PA however, every Markov basis is norm-like (Proposition 3.7).\\nExample 3.4. For any n ∈N, consider the normal set Fn := ([2]×[n]×{0})∪{(2, n, 1)} with\\nthe Markov basis {(0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (−1, 0, −1)}. The distance between (1, 1, 0) and (2, 1, 0)\\nin Fn(M) is 2n and thus M is not norm-like for {Fn : n ∈N} (see also Figure 2).\\nExample 3.5. Let d ∈N and consider A := (1, . . . , 1) ∈Z1×d, then the set M := {e1 −ei :\\n2 ≤i ≤d} is a Markov basis for the collection PA. However, M is not ∥·∥p-norm-reducing for\\nany d ≥3 and any p ∈[1, ∞]. For instance, consider e2 and e3 in FA,1 (M). The only move\\nfrom M that can be applied on e2 is e1−e2, but ∥(e2+e1−e2)−e3)∥p = ∥e2−e3∥p. On the other\\nhand, in the case we cannot ﬁnd a move that decreases the 1-norm of two nodes u, v ∈FA,b\\nby 1, we can ﬁnd instead two moves m1, m2 ∈M such that u + m1, u + m1 + m2 ∈FA,b and\\n∥u + m1 + m2 −v∥= ∥u −v∥−2. Thus, the graph-distance of any two elements u and v in\\nFA,b (M) is at most ∥u −v∥1 and hence M is norm-like for PA.\\nFigure 2. The graph from Example 3.4\\nRemark 3.6. Let P be a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd and M ⊂Zd be norm-like for P.\\nIt follows from the deﬁnition that there exists a constant C ∈Q≥0 such that for all F ∈P\\ndiam(F(M)) ≤C · max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈F}.\\nThe proof of our next results uses the Graver basis GA ⊂Zd for an integer matrix A ∈Zm×d\\nwith kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0}. We refer to [4, Chapter 3] for a precise deﬁnition.\\nProposition 3.7. Let A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and M ⊂kerZ(A) be a Markov\\nbasis of PA. Then M is norm-like for PA.\\nProof. Let M be a Markov basis for PA. The Graver basis GA for A is a ﬁnite set which\\nis ∥· ∥1-norm-reducing for PA. Thus, deﬁne C := maxg∈GA diam(FA,Ag+ (M)). Now, pick\\nu, v ∈FA,b arbitrarily and let u = v + Pr\\ni=1 gi be a walk from u to v in FA,b (GA) of minimal\\nlength. Since the Graver basis is norm-reducing for FA,b, there always exists a path of length\\nat most ∥u −v∥1 and hence r ≤∥u −v∥1. Every gi can be replaced by a path in FA,Ag+\\ni (M)\\n6\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nof length at most C and these paths stay in FA,b. This gives a path of length C · r, hence\\ndistFA,b(M)(u, v) ≤C∥u −v∥1.\\n□\\nProposition 3.8. Let P ⊂Zd be a polytope with dim(P ∩Zd) > 0 and let M be a Markov\\nbasis for Fi := (i · P) ∩Zd for all i ∈N. There exists a constant C′ ∈Q>0 such that for all\\ni ∈N, C′ · i ≤diam(Fi(M)). If M is norm-like for {Fi : i ∈N}, then there exists a constant\\nC ∈Q>0 such that diam(Fi(M)) ≤C · i for all i ∈N.\\nProof. For the lower bound on the diameter, it suﬃces to show the existence of C′ such that\\nC′ · i ≤max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈Fi} for all i ∈N due to Lemma 3.1. Since dim(P ∩Zd) > 0,\\nwe can pick distinct w, w′ ∈P ∩Zd. For all i ∈N, i · w, i · w′ ∈Fi and hence i · ∥w −w′∥≤\\nmax{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈Fi}.\\nTo show the upper bound, assume that M is norm-like. It suﬃces to show that there\\nexists C ∈Q≥0 such that max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈Fi} ≤i · C by Remark 3.6.\\nNow, let\\nv1, . . . , vr ∈Qd such that P = convQ(v1, . . . , vr) and deﬁne C := max{∥vs −vt∥: s ̸= t}.\\nSince Fi = (i·P)∩Zd ⊂convQ(iv1, . . . , ivr) for all i ∈N, we have max{∥u−v∥: u, v ∈Fi} ≤\\nmax{∥ivs −ivt∥: s ̸= t} ≤C · i.\\n□\\nRemark 3.9. Let A ∈Zm×n with kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and let M be a Markov basis for PA.\\nThen M is norm-like due to Proposition 3.7 and thus for all b ∈NA there exists C, C′ ∈Q≥0\\nsuch that\\ni · C′ ≤diam(FA,ib (M)) ≤i · C\\nfor all i ∈N. This generalizes for instance [20, Proposition 2.10] and [27, Example 4.7], where\\nlinear diameters on a ray in NA have been observed. This also implies that the construction\\nof expanders from [27, Section 4] works for every right-hand side b ∈NA.\\nRemark 3.10. Let A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A)∩Nd = {0}, b ∈NA, and let M be a Markov basis\\nfor PA. Proposition 3.8 provides a new proof that the simple walk on (FA,ib (M))i∈N cannot\\nmix rapidly. The lower bound on the diameter from Proposition 3.8 implies, in general, the\\nfollowing upper bound on the edge-expansion (see for example [9, Proposition 1.30]):\\nh(FA,i·b (M)) ≤|M|\\n\\x12\\nexp\\n\\x12log |FA,i·b|\\nD · i\\n\\x13\\n−1\\n\\x13\\n.\\nIn particular, the edge-expansion cannot be bounded from below by Ω( 1\\np(i))i∈N for a polyno-\\nmial p ∈Q[t] and since (|FA,i·b|)i∈N ∈O(ir)i∈N, the simple walk cannot mix rapidly. In [27],\\nit was shown that the edge-expansion can be bounded from above by O(1\\ni )i∈N, which cannot\\nbe concluded from the upper expression.\\nWe now turn our attention to the diameter of compressed ﬁber graphs.\\nIn particular,\\nwe want to know for which collections of normal sets is their diameter bounded. In general,\\ncompressing a ﬁber graph does not necessarily have an eﬀect on the diameter (Example 3.11).\\nAlthough a low diameter is a necessary condition for good mixing, it is not suﬃcient. For\\ninstance, let Gn be the disjoint union of two complete graphs Kn connected by a single edge.\\nThen diam(Gn) = 3, but h(Gn) ≤1\\nn implies that the simple walk does not mix rapidly.\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n7\\nExample 3.11. For any n ∈N, let Fn := {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), . . . , (n, n)} ⊂Z2. The\\nunit vectors M = {e1, e2} are a Markov basis for {Fn : n ∈N}.

Heat-bath random walks\\nIn this section, we establish the heat-bath random walk on compressed ﬁber graphs. We\\nrefer to [8] for a more general introduction on random walks of heat-bath type. Let F ⊂Zd\\nbe ﬁnite set. For any u ∈F and m ∈Zd, the ray in F through u along m is denoted by\\nRF,m(u) := (u + m · Z) ∩F. Additionally, given a mass function π : F →[0, 1], we deﬁne\\nHπ\\nF,m(x, y) :=\\n(\\nπ(y)\\nπ(RF,m(x))\\n, if y ∈RF,m(x)\\n0\\n, otherwise\\nfor x, y ∈F. For M ⊂Zd and a mass function f : M →[0, 1], the heat-bath random walk is\\n(4.1)\\nHπ,f\\nF,M =\\nX\\nm∈M\\nf(m) · Hπ\\nF,m.\\nThe underlying graph of the heat-bath random walk is the compression Fc(M) and in this\\nsection, we assume throughout that for all m ∈M and λ ∈Z \\\\ {−1, 1}, λ · m ̸∈M. Let us\\nﬁrst recall the basic properties of this random walk (compare also to [6, Lemma 2.2]).\\nAlgorithm 1 Heat-bath random walk on compressed ﬁber graphs\\nInput: F ⊂Zd, M ⊂Zd, v ∈F, mass functions f : M →[0, 1] and π : F →[0, 1], r ∈N\\n1: procedure HeatBath:\\n2:\\nv0 := v\\n3:\\nFOR s = 0; s = s + 1, s < r\\n4:\\nSample m ∈M according to f\\n5:\\nSample vs+1 ∈RF,m(vs) according to RF,m(vs) →[0, 1], y 7→\\nπ(y)\\nπ(RF,m(vs))\\n6:\\nRETURN v1, . . . , vr\\nProposition 4.1. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets. Let f : M →[0, 1] and π : F →\\n(0, 1) be mass functions. Then Hπ,f\\nF,M is aperiodic, has stationary distribution π, is reversible\\nwith respect to π, and all of its eigenvalues are non-negative. The random walk is irreducible\\nif and only if {m ∈M : f(m) > 0} is a Markov basis for F.\\nProof. Since for any u ∈F and any m ∈M, Hπ\\nF,m(u, u) > 0, there are halting states and\\nthus Hπ,f\\nF,M is aperiodic. By deﬁnition, π(x)Hπ\\nF,m(x, y) = π(y)Hπ\\nF,m(y, x) and thus Hπ,f\\nF,M\\nis reversible with respect to π and π is a stationary distribution.\\nThe statement on the\\neigenvalues is exactly [8, Lemma 1.2]. Let M′ = {m ∈M : f(m) > 0} and f ′ = f|M′, then\\nHπ,f\\nF,M = Hπ,f′\\nF,M′ and thus the heat-bath random walk is irreducible if and only if M′ is a\\nMarkov basis for F.\\n□\\nRemark 4.2. Analyzing the speed of convergence of random walks with second largest\\neigenvalues does not take the computation time of a single transition into account. From\\na computational point of view, the diﬀerence of the simple walk and the heat-bath random\\nwalk is Step 4 of Algorithm 1. However, we argue that Step 4 can be done eﬃciently in\\nmany cases. For instance, a hard normalizing constant of π cancels out. If π is the uniform\\ndistribution, then one needs to sample uniformly from RF,m(v) in Step 4, which can be done\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n9\\neﬃciently. If the input of Algorithm 1 is a normal set F = {u ∈Zd : Au ≤b} that is given\\nin H-representation, then the length of the ray RF,m(v) can be computed with a number of\\nrounding, division, and comparing operations that is linear in the number of rows of A.\\nThere are situations in which the heat-bath random walk provides no speed-up compared\\nwith the simple walk (Example 4.3). Intuitively, adding more moves to the set of allowed\\nmoves should improve the mixing time of the random walk. In general, however, this is not\\ntrue for the heat-bath walk (Example 4.4).\\nExample 4.3. For n ∈N, consider the normal set\\nFn :=\\n\\x1a\\x14\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n· · ·\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n\\x15\\n,\\n\\x14\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n· · ·\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n\\x15\\n, . . . ,\\n\\x14\\n1\\n1\\n· · ·\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n1\\n\\x15\\x1b\\n⊂Q2×n.\\nIn the language of [7, Section 1.1], Fn is precisely the ﬁber of the 2 × n independence model\\nwhere row sums are (n −1, 1) and column sums are (1, 1, . . . , 1).\\nThe minimal Markov\\nbasis of the independence model, often referred to as the basic moves, is precisely the set\\nMn := {v −u : u, v ∈Fn} \\\\ {0}. In particular, the ﬁber graph Fn(Mn) is the complete\\ngraph on n nodes. All rays along basic moves have length 2 and thus the transition matrices\\nof the simple random walk and the heat-bath random walk coincide. There are n · (n −1)\\nmany basic moves and the transition matrix of both random walks is\\n1\\nn(n −1)\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n...\\n...\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fa\\uf8fb+ (n(n −1) −n)\\nn(n −1)\\n· In.\\nThe second largest eigenvalue is 1 −\\n1\\nn−1 which implies that for n →∞, neither the simple\\nwalk nor the heat-bath random walk are rapidly mixing.\\nExample 4.4. Let F = [2] × [5] ⊂Z2, M = {e1, e2, 2e1 + e2}, and let π be the uniform\\ndistribution on F.\\nSince {e2, 2e1 + e2} is not a Markov basis for F, any mass function\\nf : M →[0, 1] must have f(e1) > 0 in order to make the corresponding heat-bath random\\nwalk irreducible.\\nComparing the second largest eigenvalue modulus of heat-bath random\\nwalks that sample from {e1, e2} and M uniformly, we obtain\\nλ\\n\\x121\\n2Hπ\\nF,e1 + 1\\n2Hπ\\nF,e2\\n\\x13\\n= 1\\n2 < 2\\n3 = λ\\n\\x121\\n3Hπ\\nF,e1 + 1\\n3Hπ\\nF,e2 + 1\\n3Hπ\\nF,2e1+e2\\n\\x13\\n.\\nSo, adding 2e1 + e2 to the set of allowed moves slows the walk down. This phenomenon does\\nnot appear for the simple walk on F, where the second largest eigenvalue modulus improves\\nfrom ≈0.905 to ≈0.888 when adding the move 2e1 + e2 to the Markov basis.\\n=\\n+\\n+\\nFigure 3.

If the moves are selected uniformly, then the heat-bath random walk on\\nF coincides with the Glauber dynamics on F. To see it, choose u ∈F and let\\nF′ := {λ ∈Zd : u + λ1m1 + · · · + λdmd ∈F}.\\nIt is easy to check that F′ is unique up to translation and depends only on F, u, and M.\\nSince the vectors in M are linearly independent, every element of F can be represented by\\na unique choice of coeﬃcients in F′. Thus, the heat-bath random walk on F using M is\\nequivalent to the heat-bath random walk on on F′ using the unit vectors as moves. For any\\nunit vector ei ∈Zd, the ray through an element v ∈F′ is {w ∈F : wj = vj∀j ̸= i} and this\\nis precisely the form desired in the Glauber dynamics [14, Section 3.3.2].\\nFor the remainder of this section, we primarily focus on heat-bath random walks Hπ,f\\nF,M\\nthat converge to the uniform distribution π on a ﬁnite, but not necessarily normal, set\\nF. We particularly aim for bounds on its second largest eigenvalue by making use of the\\ndecomposition from equation 4.1. Our ﬁrst observations consider its summands Hπ\\nF,m that\\ncan be well understood analytically (Proposition 4.6) and combinatorially (Proposition 4.7).\\nProposition 4.6. Let F ⊂Zd be a ﬁnite set, m ∈Zd, and π : F →[0, 1] be the uniform\\ndistribution. Let R1, . . . , Rk be the disjoint rays through F along m. Then\\n1.

The spectrum of Hπ\\nF,m is {0, 1}.\\nProof. Symmetry of Hπ\\nF,m follows from the deﬁnition. By assumption, F is the disjoint union\\nof R1, . . . , Rk and hence there exists a permutation matrix S such that SHπ\\nF,mST is a block\\nmatrix whose building blocks are the matrices\\n1\\n|Ri|\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n...\\n...\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fa\\uf8fb∈Q|Ri|×|Ri|.\\nThus, Hπ\\nF,m is idempotent and the rank of Hπ\\nF,m is k.

Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets, π : F →[0, 1] be the uniform\\ndistribution, and let V1, . . . , Vc ⊆F be the nodes of the connected components of F(M), then\\n\\\\\\nm∈M\\nimg(Hπ\\nF,m) = spanR\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f3\\nX\\nx∈V1\\nex, . . . ,\\nX\\nx∈Vc\\nex\\n\\uf8fc\\n\\uf8fd\\n\\uf8fe.\\nProof. It is clear by Proposition 4.6 that the set on the right-hand side is contained in any\\nimg(Hπ\\nF,m) since any Vi decomposes disjointly into rays along m ∈M. To show the other\\ninclusion, write M = {m1, . . . , mk} and let for any i ∈[k], Ri\\n1, . . . , Ri\\nni be the disjoint rays\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n11\\nthrough F parallel to mi. In particular, {Ri\\n1, . . . , Ri\\nni} is a partition of F for any i ∈[k]. Let\\nv ∈T\\nm∈M img(Hπ\\nF,m).

We show that for any i ∈[k] and any a ∈[c], λi\\nj = λi\\nj′\\nwhen Ri\\nj and Ri\\nj′ are a subset of Va. This implies the proposition. So take distinct x, x′ ∈Va\\nand assume that x and x′ lie on diﬀerent rays of mi and let that be x ∈Ri\\nj and x′ ∈Ri\\nj′ with\\nj ̸= j′. Since x and x′ are in the same connected component Va of F(M), let yi0, . . . , yir ∈F\\nbe the nodes on a minimal path in Fc(M) with yi0 = x and yir = x′. For any s ∈[r], yis\\nand yis−1 are contained in the same ray Rks\\nts coming from a Markov move mks.

For a\\nﬁnite set M ⊂Zd, the graph Fc(M) has the intersecting ray property if all (m, m′) have the\\nintersecting ray property in F.\\nExample 4.14. The compressed ﬁber graph on [n1] × · · · × [nd] ⊂Zd that uses the unit\\nvectors {e1, . . . , ed} as moves has the intersecting ray property. On the other hand, consider\\nF = {u ∈N2 : u1 + u2 ≤1} and take the rays R1 := {(0, 0), (0, 1)} and R2 := {(1, 0)}\\nthat are parallel to e2 and the rays R′\\n1 := {(0, 1)} and R′\\n2 := {(0, 0), (1, 0)} that are parallel\\nto e1.

Let\\nV1, . . . , Vc be the connected components of F(M′), πi : Vi →[0, 1] the uniform distribution,\\nand f ′ = (1 −f(m))−1 · f|M′, then\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤f(m) + (1 −f(m)) · max{λ(Hπi,f′\\nVi,M′) : i ∈[c]}.\\nProof. Let H := Hπ,f′\\nF,M′ be the heat-bath random walk on F(M) that samples moves from M′\\naccording to f ′, then Hπ,f\\nF,M = f(m)·Hπ\\nF,m +(1−f(m))·H. By assumption, all pairs (m, m′)\\nwith m′ ∈M′ have the intersecting ray property and thus the matrices Hπ\\nF,m and H commute\\naccording to Proposition 4.15. The eigenvalues of all involved matrices are non-negative and\\nthus Lemma 4.16 implies that the second largest eigenvalue of Hπ,f\\nF,M has the form λ + λ′\\nwhere λ ∈{0, f(m)} by Proposition 4.6 and where λ′ is an eigenvalue of (1 −f(m)) · H. The\\nmatrix H is a block matrix whose building blocks are the matrices Hπ,f′\\nVi,M′ = Hπi,f′\\nVi,M′ and thus\\nthe statement follows.\\n□\\nProposition 4.18. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zk be ﬁnite sets.

Let M = {m1, . . . , mk}.\\nThe intersecting ray property and Proposition 4.15 give\\nthat the matrices f(m1) · Hπ\\nF,mi, . . . , f(mk) · Hπ\\nF,mk commute pairwise. According to Propo-\\nsition 4.6, the eigenvalues of f(mi) · Hπ\\nF,mi are {0, f(mi)}. Lemma 4.16 gives that the second\\nlargest eigenvalue of Hπ,f\\nF,M, which equals the second largest eigenvalue modulus since all of\\nits eigenvalues are non-negative, fulﬁlls λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) = P\\ni∈I f(mi) for a subset I ⊆[k]. Since\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) < 1 and Pk\\ni=1 f(mi) = 1, we have I ̸= [k] and the claim follows.\\n□\\nProposition 4.19. Let n1, . . . , nd ∈N>1, F = [n1]×· · ·×[nd], and M = {e1, . . . , ed}. Then\\nfor any positive mass function f : M →[0, 1], λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) = 1 −min(f).\\nProof. It is easy to verify that Fc(M) has the intersecting ray property and thus Proposi-\\ntion 4.18 shows λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤1−min(f). Assume that min(f) = f(ei). The connected compo-\\nnents of Fc({e1, . . . , ed} \\\\ {ei}) are the layers Vj := {u ∈F : ui = j} for any j ∈[ni] and the\\nrays through F parallel are Rk := {(0, k)+s·ei : s ∈[ni]} for k = (k1, . . . , ki−1, ki+1, . . . , kd) ∈\\n[n1] × · · · × [ni−1] × [ni+1] × · · · × [nd]. In particular, any ray intersects any connected com-\\nponent exactly once.\\nThus, the matrix (|Rk ∩Vj|)k,j is the all-ones matrix, which has a\\nnon-trivial kernel. Proposition 4.12 implies λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≥1 −f(ei).\\n□\\nRemark 4.20. In the special case n := n1 = · · · = nd and f : {e1, . . . , ed} →[0, 1] the\\nuniform distribution in Proposition 4.19, the heat-bath random walk on [n]d is known as\\nRook’s walk in the literature. In this case, Proposition 4.19 is exactly [13, Proposition 2.3].\\nIn [18], upper bounds on the mixing time of the Rook’s walk were obtained with path-coupling.\\nThe stationary distribution of the heat-bath random walk is independent of the actual\\nmass function on the Markov moves. The problem of ﬁnding the mass function which leads\\n14\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nto the fastest mixing behaviour can be formulated as the following optimization problem:\\n(4.2)\\narg min\\n(\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) : f : M →(0, 1),\\nX\\nm∈M\\nf(m) = 1\\n)\\n.\\nIt follows from Proposition 4.19 that the optimal value of (4.2) for F = [n1] × · · · × [nd],\\nM = {e1, . . . , ed}, and the uniform distribution π on F is the uniform distribution on M.\\nAnother example where the uniform distribution is the optimal solution to (4.2), but where\\nthe veriﬁcation is more involved, is presented in Example 4.21.\\nExample 4.21. Let F = [2] × [5] as in Example 4.4 and consider M = {e1, 2e1 + e2}. We\\ninvestigate for which µ ∈(0, 1), the transition matrix µHπ\\nF,e1 + (1 −µ)Hπ\\nF,2e1+e2 has the\\nsmallest second largest eigenvalue modulus. Its characteristic polynomial in Q[µ, x] is\\n−1\\n25x4(x −1)(µ + x −1)6(−5x2 + 5x + 2µ2 −2µ)(−5x2 + 5x + 4µ2 −4µ)\\nand hence its eigenvalues are\\nx1(µ) := 1,\\nx2(µ) := 1 −µ,\\nx3(µ) := 1\\n2\\n\"\\n1 +\\nr\\n1 + 8\\n5(µ2 −µ)\\n#\\n,\\nx4(µ) := 1\\n2\\n\"\\n1 −\\nr\\n1 + 8\\n5(µ2 −µ)\\n#\\n,\\nx5(µ) := 1\\n2\\nh\\n1 +\\np\\n1 + 4(µ2 −µ)\\ni\\n,\\nx6(µ) := 1\\n2\\nh\\n1 −\\np\\n1 + 4(µ2 −µ)\\ni\\n.\\nIt is straightforward to check that x5(µ) > 1\\n2 > x6(µ), x3(µ) > 1\\n2 > x4(µ). Since µ2 −µ < 0\\nfor u ∈(0, 1) and x3(µ) ≥x6(µ). We can show that x4(µ) ≥x2(µ) and thus\\nλ(µHπ\\nF,e1 + (1 −µ)Hπ\\nF,2e1+e2) = 1\\n2\\n\"\\n1 +\\nr\\n1 + 8\\n5(µ2 −µ)\\n#\\n.\\nThe fastest heat-bath random walk on F(M) which converges to uniform is thus obtained for\\nµ = 1\\n2, i.e. when the moves are selected uniformly. The second largest eigenvalue in this case\\nis\\n1\\n10(5 +\\n√\\n15) ≈0.887, which is larger than the second largest eigenvalue of the heat-bath\\nwalk that selects uniformly from {e1, e2} (see Proposition 4.19).\\n5. Augmenting Markov bases\\nIt follows from our investigation in Section 3 that the diameter of all compressed ﬁber\\ngraphs coming from a ﬁxed integer matrix A ∈Zm×d can be bounded from above by a\\nconstant. However, Markov moves can be used twice in a minimal path which can make the\\ndiameter of the compressed ﬁber graph larger than the size of the Markov basis. The next\\ndeﬁnition puts more constraints on the Markov basis and postulates the existence of a path\\nthat uses every move from the Markov basis at most once.\\nDeﬁnition 5.1. Let F ⊂Zd be a ﬁnite set and M = {m1, . . . , mk} ⊂Zd. An augmenting\\npath between distinct u, v ∈F of length r ∈N is a path in Fc(M) of the form\\nu →u + λi1mi1 →u + λi1mi1 + λi2mi2 →· · · →u +\\nr\\nX\\nk=1\\nλikmik = v\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n15\\nwith distinct indices i1, . . . , ir ∈[k]. An augmenting path is minimal for u, v ∈F if there\\nexists no shorter augmenting path between u and v in Fc(M).\\nA Markov basis M for\\nF is augmenting if there is an augmenting path between any distinct nodes in F.\\nThe\\naugmentation length AM(F) of an augmenting Markov basis M is the maximum length of\\nall minimal augmenting paths in Fc(M).\\nNot every Markov basis is augmenting (see Example 3.11), but the diameter of compressed\\nﬁber graphs that use an augmenting Markov basis is at most the number of the moves. For\\nﬁber graphs coming from an integer matrix, an augmenting Markov basis for all of its ﬁbers\\ncan be computed (Remark 5.2).\\nRemark 5.2. Let A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and let b ∈NA. The Graver basis\\nis an augmenting Markov basis for FA,b for any b ∈NA. We claim that when A is totally\\nunimodular, then AGA(FA,b) ≤d2(rank(A) + 1).\\nIn particular, the augmentation length\\nis independent of the right-hand side b.\\nLet u, v ∈FA,b be arbitrary and for i ∈N, let\\nli := min{ui, vi}, wi := max{ui, vi}, and ci := sign(ui −vi) ∈{−1, 0, 1}. Then v is the unique\\noptimal value of the linear integer optimization problem\\nmin{cT x : Ax = b, l ≤x ≤w, x ∈Zd}.\\nA discrete steepest decent as deﬁned in [5, Deﬁnition 3] using Graver moves needs at most\\n∥c∥1 · d · (rank(A) + 1) ≤d2 · (rank(A) + 1) many augmentations from u to reach the optimal\\nvalue v. We refer to [5, Corollary 8] which ensures that every Graver move is used at most\\nonce. Note that in [5], x is constrained to x ≥0 instead to x ≥l, but their argument works\\nfor any lower bound.\\nExample 5.3. Fix d ∈N and consider A and M from Example 3.5. We show that M is an\\naugmenting Markov basis for FA,b for any b ∈N. Let u, v ∈FA,b be distinct, then there exists\\ni ∈[d] such that ui > vi or ui < vi, thus, we can walk from u to u′ := u + (ui −vi)(e1 −ei)\\nor from v to v′ := v + (vi −ui)(e1 −ei). In any case, after that augmentation, the pairs\\n(u′, v) and (v′, u) coincide in the ith coordinate and thus we ﬁnd an augmenting path by\\ninduction on the dimension d. We have used at most d −1 many edges in these paths and\\nhence AM(FA,b) ≤d −1 for all b ∈N.\\nWe now show that the augmentation length is essentially bounded from below by the\\ndimension of the node set and hence the bound observed in Example 5.3 cannot be improved.\\nWe ﬁrst need the following lemma.\\nLemma 5.4. Let v1, . . . , vk ∈Qd such that any v ∈spanQ {v1, . . . , vk} can be represented by\\na linear combination of r vectors. Then dim(spanQ {v1, . . . , vk}) ≤r.\\nProof. Let B ⊂P(v1, . . . , vk) the set of all subsets of cardinality r. By our assumption,\\n∪B∈BspanQ {B} = spanQ {v1, . . . , vk}. Since dim(spanQ {B}) ≤r for all B ∈B and since B\\nis ﬁnite, the claim follows.\\n□\\nProposition 5.5. Let P ⊂Qd be polytope and let M ⊂Zd be an augmenting Markov basis\\nfor Fi := (i · P) ∩Zd for all i ∈N. Then dim(P) ≤maxi∈N AM(Fi).\\n16\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nProof. Without restricting generality, we can assume that 0 ∈P. Let V := spanQ {P} be\\nthe Q-span of P, then dim(P) = dim(V ). We must have dim(spanQ {M}) = dim(V ) since\\ndim(P) = dim(convQ(Fi)) for i suﬃciently large and since M is a Markov basis for Fi. Deﬁne\\nr := maxi∈N AM(Fi) and choose any non-zero v ∈V and u ∈relint(P) ⊂Qd. Then there\\nexists δ ∈Q>0 such that u + δv ∈P. Thus, 1\\nδu + v ∈1\\nδP. Let c ∈N≥1 such that i := c\\nδ ∈N\\nand w := c\\nδu ∈Zd. Then w + cv = c(1\\nδ u + v) ∈(i · P) ∩Zd = Fi. By assumption, there exists\\nan augmenting path from w to w + cv using only r elements from M. Put diﬀerently, the\\nelement cv from V can be represented by a linear combination of r vectors from M. Since v\\nwas chosen arbitrarily, Lemma 5.4 implies dim(P) = dim(V ) ≤r.\\n□\\nRemark 5.6. It is a consequence from Proposition 5.5 that for any matrix A ∈Zm×d with\\nkerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and an augmenting Markov basis M, there exists F ∈PA such that\\nAM(F) ≥dim(kerZ(A)).\\nLet us now shortly recall the framework from [23] which is necessary to prove our main\\ntheorem. Let G = (V, E) be a graph. For any ordered pair of distinct nodes (x, y) ∈V × V ,\\nlet px,y ⊆E be a path from x to y in G and let Γ := {px,y : (x, y) ∈V × V, x ̸= y} be\\nthe collection of these paths, then Γ is a set of canonical paths. Let for any edge e ∈E,\\nΓe := {p ∈Γ : e ∈p} be the set of paths from Γ that use e. Now, let H : V × V →[0, 1] be a\\nsymmetric random walk on G and deﬁne\\nρ(Γ, H) := max{|p| : p ∈Γ}\\n|V |\\n· max\\n{u,v}∈E\\n|Γ{u,v}|\\nH(u, v).\\nObserve that symmetry of H is needed to make ρ(Γ, H) well-deﬁned. This can be used to\\nprove the following upper bound on the second largest eigenvalue.\\nLemma 5.7. Let G be a graph, H be a symmetric random walk on G, and Γ be a set of\\ncanonical paths in G. Then λ2(H) ≤1 −\\n1\\nρ(Γ,H).\\nProof. The stationary distribution of H is the uniform distribution and thus the statement\\nis a direct consequence of [23, Theorem 5], since ρ(Γ, H) is an upper bound on the constant\\ndeﬁned in [23, equation 4].\\n□\\nTheorem 5.8. Let F ⊂Zd be ﬁnite and let M := {m1, . . . , mk} ⊂Zd be an augmenting\\nMarkov basis. Let π be the uniform and f be a positive distribution on F and M respectively.\\nFor i ∈[k], let ri := max{|RF,mi(u)| : u ∈F} and suppose that r1 ≥r2 ≥· · · ≥rk. Then\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nM,F) ≤1 −\\n|F| · min(f)\\nAM(F) · AM(F)! · 3AM(F)−1 · 2|M| · r1r2 · · · rAM(F)\\n.\\nProof. Choose for any distinct u, v ∈F an augmenting path pu,v of minimal length in Fc(M)\\nand let Γ be the collection of all these paths. Let u + µmk = v be an edge in Fc(M), then\\nour goal is to bound |Γ{u,v}| from above. Let S := {S ⊆[r] : |S| ≤AM(F), k ∈S} and take\\nany path px,y ∈Γ{u,v}. Then there exists S := {i1, . . . , is} with s := |S| ≤AM(F) such that\\nx + Ps\\nk=1 λikmik = y. Since px,y uses the edge {u, v}, there is j ∈[s] such that ij = k and\\nλij = µ. Since |λik| ≤rik, there are at most\\ns! · (2ri1 + 1) · · · (2rij−1 + 1) · (2rij+1 + 1) · · · (2ris + 1) ≤s! · 3s−1\\nY\\nt∈S\\\\{k}\\nrt\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n17\\npaths in Γ{u,v} that uses the edge {u, v} and the moves mi1, . . . , mij−1, mij+1 . . . , mis.

Bounding |S| rigorously from above\\nby 2|M|, the claim follows from Lemma 5.7.\\n□\\nDeﬁnition 5.9. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets. The longest ray through F along\\nvectors of M is RF,M := arg max{|RF,m(u)| : m ∈M, u ∈F}.\\nCorollary 5.10. Let (Fi)i∈N be a sequence of ﬁnite sets in Zd and let πi be the uniform\\ndistribution on Fi. Let M ⊂Zd be an augmenting Markov basis for Fi with AM(Fi) ≤\\ndim(Fi) and suppose that (|RFi,M|)dim(Fi))i∈N ∈O(|Fi|)i∈N.\\nThen for any positive mass\\nfunction f : M →[0, 1], there exists ǫ > 0 such that λ(Hπi,f\\nFi,M) ≤1 −ǫ for all i ∈N.\\nProof. This is a straightforward application of Theorem 5.8.\\n□\\nCorollary 5.11. Let P ⊂Zd be a polytope, Fi := (i · P) ∩Zd for i ∈N, and let πi be the\\nuniform distribution on Fi. Suppose that M ⊂Zd is an augmenting Markov basis {Fi : i ∈N}\\nsuch that AM(Fi) ≤dim(P) for all i ∈N. Then for any positive mass function f : M →[0, 1],\\nthere exists ǫ > 0 such that λ(Hπi,f\\nFi,M) ≤1 −ǫ for all i ∈N.\\nProof. Let r := dim(P). We ﬁrst show that (|RFi,M|)i∈N ∈O(i)i∈N. Write M = {m1, . . . , mk}\\nand denote by li := max{|(u + mi · Z) ∩P| : u ∈P} be the length of the longest ray through\\nthe polytope P along mi. It suﬃces to prove that i · (lk + 1) is an upper bound on the\\nlength of any ray along mk through Fi. For that, let u ∈Fi such that u + λmk ∈Fi for\\nsome λ ∈N, then 1\\ni u + λ\\ni mk ∈P and thus ⌊λ\\ni ⌋≤lk, which gives λ ≤i · (lk + 1). With\\nC := max{l1, . . . , lk} + 1 we have |RFi,M| ≤C · i. Ehrhart’s theorem [2, Theorem 3.23]\\ngives (|Fi|)i∈N ∈Ω(ir)i∈N and since |RFi,M| ≤C · i, we have (|RFi,M|r)i∈N ∈O(|Fi|)i∈N. An\\napplication of Corollary 5.10 proves the claim.\\n□\\nExample 5.12. Fix d, r ∈N and let Cd,r := {u ∈Zd : ∥u∥1 ≤r} be the set of integers of the\\nd-dimensional cross-polytope with radius r. The set Md = {e1, . . . , ed} is a Markov basis for\\nCd,r for any r ∈N. We show that Md is an augmenting Markov basis whose augmentation\\nlength is at most d. For that, let u, v ∈Cd,r distinct elements. We claim that there exists\\ni ∈[d] such that xi ̸= vi and ui + (vi −ui) ∈Cd,r. Let S ⊆[d] be the set of indices where u\\nand v diﬀer and let s = r −||u||1. If |S| = 1, then the result is clear so suppose |S| ≥2. If\\nthe result doesn’t hold then for all i ∈S, |vi| −|ui| > s. It follows that\\n∥v∥1 =\\nX\\ni/∈S\\n|ui| +\\nX\\ni∈S\\n|vi| >\\nX\\ni/∈S\\n|ui| +\\nX\\ni∈S\\ns + |ui| = |Suv| · s + ∥u∥1 = (|S| −1) · s + r.\\nBut we assumed that v ∈Cd,r. It follows that for any pair of points u, v in Cd,r, there is a\\nwalk, using the unit vectors as moves, that uses each move at most once. Corollary 5.10 yield\\nthat for any d ∈N, the second largest eigenvalue modulus of the heat-bath random walk on\\nCd,r with uniform as stationary distribution can be strictly bounded away from 1 for r →∞.\\n18\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nThe bound on the second largest eigenvalue in Theorem 5.8 is quite general and can be\\nimproved vastly, provided one has better control over the paths. For example, this can be\\nachieved for hyperrectangles intersected with a halfspace.\\nProposition 5.13. Let a ∈Nd\\n>0, b ∈N, F = {u ∈Nd : aT · u ≤b}, and M := {e1, . . . , ed}.\\nIf π and f are the uniform distributions on F and M respectively, then\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤1 −|F|\\nd2\\nd\\nY\\ni=1\\nai\\nb .\\nProof. Observe that M is a Markov basis for F since all nodes are connected with 0 ∈F.\\nLet u, v ∈F be distinct. We ﬁrst show that there exists k ∈[d] such that uk ̸= vk and\\nu + (vk −uk)ek ∈F. If u ≤v, the statement trivially holds. Otherwise, there exists k ∈[d]\\nsuch that uk > vk and the vector obtained by replacing the kth coordinate of u by vk remains\\nin F. Now, consider for the following path between u and v: Choose the smallest index\\nk ∈[d] such that uk ̸= vk and such that u + (vk −uk) · ek ∈F and proceed recursively with\\nu + (vk −uk) and v. This gives a path pu,v between u and v of length at most d. Let Γ be\\nthe collection of all these paths. We want to apply Lemma 5.7. Thus, let x ∈F and consider\\nthe edge x →x + c · es. Let us count the paths pu,v that use that edge. Let u, v ∈F and let\\nk1, . . . , kr ∈[d] be distinct indices such that\\nu →u + (vk1 −uk1)ek1 →u + (vk1 −uk1)ek1 + (vk2 −uk2)ek2 →· · · →v\\nrepresents the path pu,v constructed by the upper rule.\\nAssume that pu,v uses the edge\\n{x, x + ces} and let kl = s and (vkl −ukl) = c. In particular,\\nu + (vk1 −uk1)ek1 + · · · + (vkl−1 −ukl−1)ekl−1 = x\\nx + (vkl −ukl)ekl + · · · + (vkr −ukr)ekr = v.\\nWe see that vkt = xkt for all t < l and that ukt = xkt for all t ≥l. In particular, vkl =\\nukl + c = xkl + c is also ﬁxed. The coordinates ukt and vkt are bounded from above by\\nb\\nakt\\nfor all t ∈[r], and hence there can be at most\\n l−1\\nY\\nt=1\\nb\\nakt\\n!\\n·\\n \\nr\\nY\\nt=l+1\\nb\\nakt\\n!\\n.\\nSince k1, . . . , kt are distinct coordinate indices, we have\\n|Γx,x+c·es|\\nHπ,f\\nF,M(x, x + c · es)\\n≤d ·\\nd\\nY\\ni=1\\nb\\nai\\n.\\nLemma 5.7 ﬁnishes the proof.\\n□\\nIn ﬁxed dimension, Proposition 5.13 leads to rapid mixing, but for d →∞, no statement\\ncan be made. In [19], it was shown that the simple walk with an additional halting probability\\non {u ∈Nd : atu ≤b} ∩{0, 1}d has mixing time in O(d4.5+ǫ). For zero-one polytopes, simple\\nand heat-bath walk coincide and we are conﬁdent that a similar statement holds without the\\nrestriction on zero-one polytopes.\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n19\\nThe heat-bath random walk mixes rapidly when an augmenting Markov basis with a small\\naugmentation length is used.\\nWe think that it is interesting to question how might an\\naugmenting Markov bases be obtained and how their augmentation length can be improved.\\nQuestion 5.14. Let M be an augmenting Markov basis of A. Can we ﬁnd ﬁnitely many\\nmoves m1, . . . , mk such that the augmentation length of M∪{m1, . . . , mk} on FA,b is at most\\ndim(kerZ(A)) for all b ∈NA?\\nReferences\\n1.
